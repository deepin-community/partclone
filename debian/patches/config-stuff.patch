Description: migration to automake 1.13
 Automake 1.13 breaks many configurations which were based on obsoleted constructs
 This migrations was mostly based on the use of 'gettextize -f' after updating
 Gettext to the latest version. Other modifications have been driven by warnings
 issued by autoreconf (more precisely by automake, which is called by autoreconf)
 .
 This patch contains all the modifications which make the package buildable in
 a recent environment.
 .
 Another change was made on 2021-10-26: applied `autoupdate` to get rid
 of recently obsoleted constructs.
